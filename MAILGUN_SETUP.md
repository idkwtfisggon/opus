## ðŸŽ¯ What's Been Built

### Complete Email Processing System
- **Email Schema**: Database tables for customer emails, shipping confirmations, and spam detection
- **Webhook Endpoint**: `/api/webhooks/mailgun` to receive emails from Mailgun
- **Email Processing**: Automatic extraction of tracking numbers, order numbers, shop names
- **PDF Processing**: Extract data from shipping label attachments
- **Spam Detection**: Smart filtering to only process shipping emails
- **Auto-Forwarding**: Forward shipping confirmations to customer's real email
- **Customer Dashboard**: Interface to generate email addresses and view shipping emails

### Your Mailgun Credentials
- **API Key**: Set in environment variable `MAILGUN_API_KEY`
- **Domain**: `sandbox66b2007e061f4536af04dca475932b61.mailgun.org`
- **Region**: US

## ðŸ”§ Next Steps to Go Live

### 1. Configure Mailgun Webhook
In your Mailgun dashboard:
1. Go to **Sending** â†’ **Webhooks**
2. Add new webhook:
   - **URL**: `https://your-app-domain.com/api/webhooks/mailgun`
   - **Event Type**: `Incoming Messages`
   - **Method**: POST

### 2. Test Email Processing
1. Generate a customer email address in the app
2. Send a test shipping confirmation to that address
3. Check the customer dashboard to see if it was processed
4. Verify the email was forwarded to the customer's real email

### 3. Real Domain Setup (When Ready)
1. Buy a domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
2. Add domain to Mailgun
3. Configure DNS records (MX, TXT, CNAME)
4. Update email generation to use real domain
5. Configure webhook with production URL

## ðŸ“§ How It Works

### Customer Experience
1. **Generate Email**: Customer generates `cust-abc123@yourdomain.com`
2. **Shop at Checkout**: Uses generated email when shopping online
3. **Auto-Processing**: Shipping confirmations are automatically processed
4. **Get Forwarded**: Clean emails forwarded to customer's real email
5. **Track in Dashboard**: View all shipping emails and tracking numbers

### Email Processing Pipeline
```
1. Email arrives at Mailgun
2. Webhook sends to your app
3. Extract tracking numbers, shop info
4. Run spam detection
5. Store in database
6. Forward to customer's real email
7. Match to existing orders
```

### Smart Features
- **PDF Extraction**: Reads tracking numbers from shipping label PDFs
- **Shop Detection**: Identifies Amazon, AliExpress, etc. automatically
- **Order Matching**: Links emails to existing customer orders
- **Spam Filtering**: Only processes legitimate shipping emails
- **Confidence Scoring**: Shows reliability of extracted data

## ðŸ§ª Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Basic Email Processing
Send email with tracking number to generated customer email:
```
To: cust-abc123@sandbox66b2007e061f4536af04dca475932b61.mailgun.org
Subject: Your order has shipped
Body: Your order #12345 has shipped. Tracking: 1Z999AA1234567890
```

### Test 2: PDF Attachment
Send email with PDF shipping label attachment - system should extract tracking from PDF.

### Test 3: Spam Detection
Send non-shipping email (newsletter, promotion) - should be filtered out and not forwarded.

## ðŸ“Š What You Can Monitor

### Customer Dashboard
- Generated email addresses
- Email statistics (total, shipping, spam, matched)
- Recent shipping confirmations with tracking numbers
- Confidence scores for each email

### Database Tables
- `customerEmailAddresses`: Generated email addresses
- `emailMessages`: All processed emails with extracted data
- Spam detection results and confidence scores

## ðŸš€ Production Considerations

### Security
- Webhook signature verification (not implemented yet)
- Rate limiting on email processing
- Customer data privacy compliance

### Scaling
- Handle high email volumes
- Batch processing for efficiency
- CDN for attachment storage

### Monitoring
- Email processing success rates
- Spam detection accuracy
- Customer satisfaction with forwarding

## ðŸ’¡ Next Features to Add

1. **Browser Extension**: Auto-fill generated emails at checkout
2. **Email Templates**: Prettier forwarded email formatting
3. **Order Auto-Creation**: Create orders from shipping emails
4. **Delivery Notifications**: Parse delivery confirmations
5. **Return Labels**: Handle return shipping emails

The system is now ready for testing! Just need to configure the Mailgun webhook to point to your deployed app.
