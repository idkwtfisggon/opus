# Project Analysis - August 20, 2025

## Executive Summary

**Opus1** is a sophisticated **Package Forwarding/Mail Forwarding Platform** that operates as a two-sided marketplace connecting international customers with local forwarders. The platform solves the "international shipping barrier" by providing customers with local warehouse addresses in multiple countries, enabling them to shop from local stores and have packages professionally forwarded to their international destinations.

## Core Business Model

### Value Proposition
- **For Customers**: Access to international shopping through local warehouse addresses, automated email management, and transparent package tracking
